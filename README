This is a Plex channel with some of my favorite webisodes on it.

It can pull shows with available Plex URL services that are RSS feeds, from Hulu, from Yahoo, or YouTube Playlist.

It pulls shows from a JSON file. So you can add the necessary data for the show to the JSON file and it will produce that show.
