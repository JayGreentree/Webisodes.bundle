This is a Plex channel that can pull your favorite webisodes on it.

It can pull shows with available Plex URL services that are RSS feeds, from Hulu, from Yahoo, Vimeo, BlipTV, or YouTube Playlist.

It requires special instructions to add shows if you are a Roku users and the specific structure of the shows URL. Please see the notes below or the user entry instructions text file before using the channel.

NOTES AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS CHANNEL

With this channel you can add shows from all the sources listed.  I have also added a "Channel Tools" section with some additional tools that can be useful including resetting the shows to the default in case you have any problems, instructions for Roku users, and a Roku Dummy Search, (see Roku User notes below for full explanation). 

RSS feeds seems to work for any RSS feed, I have tested so far, as long as there is already a Plex URL service for the webstie. So you cannot enter a URL, for example, your local news station unless someone has created a URL service for it. I have included error testing, so the channel will tell you if no URL service exists for the show you entered.  

The Hulu section only allows for adding their original shows that allow viewing through their site without having to enter a username and password. It is not a substitute for the Hulu channel and will not pull up your queue or any other data specific to your account.

The format for the URL to be entered is given below and usually follows the URL address given in your browsers address bar:

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ROKU USERS:
THE ROKU USER ENTRY ONLY RETURNS A SEARCH PAGE, SO DIRECT USER ENTRY IS NOT AN OPTION FOR ROKU USERS. ALSO, THE SEARCH ENTRY PAGE FOR ROKU WILL RETURN AN ENTRY FOR EVERY LETTER OF THE URL ADDRESS THAT YOU ENTER SO YOU MUST ONLY ADD SHOWS BY CHOOSING A URL LISTED IN YOUR RECENT SEARCHES BOX ON THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN.
THESE ARE QUIRKS IN THE PLEX SYSTEM FOR WHICH I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A SOLUTION.  THEREFORE, FOR ROKU USERS TO ENTER A URL ADDRESS, YOU MUST FIRST HAVE A LINK TO THE REMOKU WEB BASED REMOTE CONTROL AT http://remoku.tv/ AND LINK IT TO THE ADDRESS OF YOUR ROKU MACHINE. INSTRUCTIONS AND MORE INFO ARE AVAILABLE AT http://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=46852.
ONCE YOU HAVE REMOKU RUNNING IN YOUR BROWSER, YOU CAN THEN CAN COPY AND PASTE THE URL ADDRESS INTO THE REMOKU.  BUT SINCE THE ROKU ADDS AN ENTRY FOR EVERY LETTER OF THE URL, I HAVE CREATED A DUMMY SEARCH PAGE 
IN THE CHANNEL TOOLS SECTION OF THE WEBISODE CHANNEL.  SO TO ADD A NEW SHOW FROM ROKU, USE THE ROKU DUMMY SEARCH PAGE IN THE CHANNEL, CUT AND PASTE THE URL FROM THE WEBSITE INTO YOUR REMOKU AND HIT ENTER, AND WHEN THE FULL ADDRESS HAS TRANSFERRED FROM REMOKU TO THE THE SEARCH SCREEN, CLICK THE SEARCH BUTTON. THIS ADDS THE URL ADDRESS OF THE SHOW YOU WANT TO ADD TO THE RECENT SEARCHES LIST. 
THEN YOU CAN GO TO THE SHOW SECTION WHERE YOU WANT TO ADD THE SHOW, CHOOSE THE ADD SHOW BUTTON, AND CHOOSE THE FULL URL OF THE SHOW FROM THE RECENT SEARCHES LIST TO ADD A NEW SHOW.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ADVANCED USERS:
For those who may decide to edit the json data file attached to this channel to add shows there are a few things to keep in mind. It pulls the original list of shows from a JSON data file but then saves that list to a local dictionary file. So you can add the necessary data for the show to the JSON file but would then need to click the Reset Shows button in the Channel Tools section for it to accept these changes. 
And the numbering system must stay intact, so never completely delete an entry from the json file, just remove or add the data in the specific entry fields you want to add or delete.
