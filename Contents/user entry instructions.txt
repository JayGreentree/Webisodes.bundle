This is a Plex channel that can pull your favorite webisodes on it.

It can pull shows with available Plex URL services that are RSS feeds, from Hulu, from Yahoo, Vimeo, BlipTV, or YouTube Playlist.

It requires use of Plex Channel V2.6.5 or higher to add shows if you are a Roku users. Please see the notes below or the user entry instructions text file before using the channel.

NOTES AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS CHANNEL

With this channel you can add shows from all the sources listed.  I have also added a "Channel Tools" section with some additional tools that can be useful including resetting the shows to the default in case you have any problems and instructions for Roku users. 

RSS feeds seems to work for any RSS feed, I have tested so far, as long as there is already a Plex URL service for the webstie. So you cannot enter a URL, for example, your local news station unless someone has created a URL service for it. I have included error testing, so the channel will tell you if no URL service exists for the show you entered.  

The Hulu section only allows for adding their original shows that allow viewing through their site without having to enter a username and password. It is not a substitute for the Hulu channel and will not pull up your queue or any other data specific to your account.

The format for the URL to be entered is given below and usually follows the URL address given in your browsers address bar:

YOUTUBE

Playlist url: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl4T6p7km9dbx0o8J35KjWAwaiEo5tV7G

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ROKU USERS:
THE ROKU USERS MUST USE THE ROKU PLEX CHANNEL V2.65 (CURRENTLY REQUIRES USING THE PLEX TEST CHANNEL) TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE USER ENTRY SCREEN. VERSION 2.6.4 ONLY RETURNS A SEARCH PAGE, THAT DOES NOT ALLOW DIRECT USER ENTRY FOR ROKU USERS. ALSO, THE SEARCH ENTRY PAGE WILL RETURN AN ENTRY FOR EVERY LETTER OF THE URL ADDRESS THAT YOU ENTER.
HAVING A LINK TO THE REMOKU WEB BASED REMOTE CONTROL AT http://remoku.tv/ CAN MAKE IT VERRY EASY TO PASTE THE URL ADDRESS TO YOUR ROKU MACHINE. INSTRUCTIONS AND MORE INFO ARE AVAILABLE AT http://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=46852.
ONCE YOU HAVE REMOKU RUNNING IN YOUR BROWSER, YOU CAN THEN CAN COPY AND PASTE THE URL ADDRESS INTO THE REMOKU.  

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ADVANCED USERS:
For those who may decide to edit the json data file attached to this channel to add shows there are a few things to keep in mind. It pulls the original list of shows from a JSON data file but then saves that list to a local dictionary file. So you can add the necessary data for the show to the JSON file but would then need to click the Reset Shows button in the Channel Tools section for it to accept these changes. 
And the numbering system must stay intact, so never completely delete an entry from the json file, just remove or add the data in the specific entry fields you want to add or delete.
