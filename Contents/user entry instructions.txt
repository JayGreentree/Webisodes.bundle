With this channel you can add shows from all the sources listed.  I have also added a "Channel Tools" section with some additional tools that can be useful including resetting the shows to the default in case you have any problems, instructions for Roku users, and a Roku Dummy Search, (see Roku User notes below for full exlplanation).

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS CHANNEL DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO ENTER YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD OR PULL UP QUES OR RESTRICTED VIEWING. THIS CHANNEL CAN ONLY BE USED WITH SHOWS LIKE THEIR ORIGINAL SERIES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A USERNAME AND PASSWORD TO VIEW FROM THEIR SITE.


RSS FEEDS
Enter the RSS feed page for the show
Example: http://www.cwtv.com/feed/video/xml
IMPORTANT NOTE: THERE MUST BE A PLEX URL SERVICE FOR THE WEBSITE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE RSS FEED. OTHERWISE YOU WILL GET AN ERROR TELLING YOU THAT THE SHOW CANNOT BE CREATED DUE TO THERE NOT BEING A URL SERVICE FOR THE RSS FEED.



IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ROKU USERS:
THE ROKU USER ENTRY ONLY RETURNS A SEARCH PAGE, SO DIRECT USER ENTRY IS NOT AN OPTION FOR ROKU USERS. ALSO, THE SEARCH ENTRY PAGE FOR ROKU WILL RETURN AN ENTRY FOR EVERY LETTER OF THE URL ADDRESS THAT YOU ENTER SO YOU MUST ONLY ADD SHOWS BY CHOOSING A URL LISTED IN YOUR RECENT SEARCHES BOX ON THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN.
THESE ARE QUIRKS IN THE PLEX SYSTEM FOR WHICH I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A SOLUTION.  THEREFORE, FOR ROKU USERS TO ENTER A URL ADDRESS, YOU MUST FIRST HAVE A LINK TO THE REMOKU WEB BASED REMOTE CONTROL AT http://remoku.tv/ AND LINK IT TO THE ADDRESS OF YOUR ROKU MACHINE. INTRUCTIONS AND MORE INFO ARE AVAILABLE AT http://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=46852.
ONCE YOU HAVE REMOKU RUNNING IN YOUR BROWSER, YOU CAN THEN CAN COPY AND PAST THE URL ADDRESS INTO THE REMOKU.  BUT SINCE THE ROKU ADDS AN ENTRY FOR EVERY LETTER OF THE URL, I HAVE CREATED A DUMMY SEARCH PAGE.
IN THE CHANNEL TOOLS SECTION OF THE WEBISODE CHANNEL.  SO TO ADD A NEW SHOW FROM ROKU, USE THE ROKU DUMMY SEARCH PAGE IN THE CHANNEL, CUT AND PASTE THE URL FROM THE WEBSITE INTO YOUR REMOKU AND HIT ENTER, AND WHEN THE FULL ADDRESS HAS TRANSFERRED FROM REMOKU TO THE THE SEARCH SCREEN, CLICK THE SEARCH BUTTON. THIS ADDS THE URL ADDRESS OF THE SHOW YOU WANT TO ADD TO THE RECENT SEARCHES LIST. 
THEN YOU CAN GO TO THE SHOW SECTION WHERE YOU WANT TO ADD THE SHOW, CHOOSE THE ADD SHOW BUTTON, AND CHOOSE THE FULL URL OF THE SHOW FROM THE RECENT SEARCHES LIST TO ADD A NEW SHOW.
