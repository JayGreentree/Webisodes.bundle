It can pull shows with available Plex URL services that are RSS feeds, from Yahoo, Vimeo, BlipTV, or YouTube Playlist.

It requires use of Plex Channel V2.6.5 or higher if you are a Roku users. Please see the notes below or the user entry instructions text file before using the channel.

NOTES AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS CHANNEL

With this channel you can add shows from all the sources listed.  I have also added a "Channel Tools" section with some additional tools that can be useful including resetting the shows to the default in case you have any problems and instructions for Roku users. 

RSS feeds seems to work for any RSS feed, I have tested so far, as long as there is already a Plex URL service for the website or direct links to the video file (like .mp4) in the feed. So you cannot enter a URL, for example, your local news station unless someone has created a URL service for it or the feed contains direct links to video files. I have included error testing, so the channel will tell you if no URL service exists for the show you entered.  

The format for the URL to be entered is given below and usually follows the URL address given in your browsers address bar:

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ROKU USERS:
HAVING A LINK TO THE REMOKU WEB BASED REMOTE CONTROL AT http://remoku.tv/ CAN MAKE IT VERRY EASY TO PASTE THE URL ADDRESS TO YOUR ROKU MACHINE. INSTRUCTIONS AND MORE INFO ARE AVAILABLE AT http://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=46852.
ONCE YOU HAVE REMOKU RUNNING IN YOUR BROWSER, YOU CAN THEN CAN COPY AND PASTE THE URL ADDRESS INTO THE REMOKU.  

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ADVANCED USERS:
For those who may decide to edit the json data file attached to this channel to add shows there are a few things to keep in mind. It pulls the original list of shows from a JSON data file but then saves that list to a local dictionary file. So you can add the necessary data for the show to the JSON file but would then need to click the Reset Shows button in the Channel Tools section for it to accept these changes. 
And the numbering system must stay intact, so never completely delete an entry from the json file, just remove or add the data in the specific entry fields you want to add or delete.
